AjaxPlayer has a number of options for playing Audio and Video. It supports HTML5 and Flash, along with MP3 OGG and MP4 codecs.
You can either use included PHP scripts to create dynamic playlists based on directory contents, or choose the standard XML playlist.

The standard playlist requires no server side code and can be hosted in a dropbox or s3 bucket.

Using ajax success functions songs are loaded into the playlist. The full list of commands is currently |

 * Add Songs
 * Delete Songs
 * New Playlist (Reset)
 * Shuffle Playlist
 * Play Forever (infinite play)
